# HTML-CSS-JS Code Editor
### coded entirely in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS with no libraries (other than Font Awesome)
- **textarea** for each code flavor: HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS
- **iframe** for output, since an iframe embeds an html page within a documemt--which is just what we need to render the code
- a useful exercise in working with textareas and iframes but
leaves much to be desired: has no code hints, console/error reporting or means of saving your works
